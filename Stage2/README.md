# AI Used-Car Evaluation Assistant — Stage 2 Foundation

## Project overview

This project is the **initial Stage 2 foundation** for the EECS3311 Fall 2026 course project. It supports a working deterministic workflow through a command-line interface (CLI) and a Swing graphical user interface (GUI): vehicle entry, session-based buyer preferences, ownership-cost estimation, data-quality checks, and buyer constraint checks. It is not a fully implemented Stage 2 application, and Gemini integration is not operational.

The `Stage2` directory is part of the existing course-project repository. The original `Project-Stage2-Instruction.pdf` is retained. The foundation was developed without modifying the Stage 1 materials, repository-root README, or Git configuration. No particular checkout location or personal Windows directory is required.

## Prerequisites

- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7 and a **Java 21 JDK**, rather than only a JRE.
- A Windows desktop display for the GUI.
- No Maven installation, network access, or API key is required for the standard script-based build or deterministic CLI/GUI workflow.
- The verification script prefers JUnit 4.13.2 and Hamcrest from an existing VS Code Java extension installation. If those libraries are unavailable, it explicitly uses the dependency-free verification runner.

The scripts check the current process's `STAGE2_JAVA_HOME`, then `JAVA_HOME`, `javac` on `PATH`, and common JDK installation directories to locate Java 21. They do not modify system-wide environment settings. During the initial scaffolding verification, the default `java` on `PATH` was Java 8; the scripts successfully located an installed Adoptium Java 21 JDK instead.

```

The application entry point is `ca.yorku.eecs3311.usedcar.app.Main`. It accepts `--demo`, `--cli`, `--gui`, and `--help`.

## Build instructions

Open the repository's `Stage2` folder in VS Code and open a terminal in that folder. **All commands below assume that the current working directory is `Stage2`.** If VS Code is opened at the repository root, navigate into its `Stage2` subdirectory before running them.

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build.ps1
```

The script compiles the application with Java 21 and creates `build/used-car-assistant.jar`. `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` applies only to the newly launched PowerShell process; it does not change the machine's execution policy. In a terminal that already permits script execution, the equivalent command is:

```powershell
& .\scripts\build.ps1
```

The scripts resolve their own Stage2 directory and do not depend on a fixed drive letter or checkout path. In PowerShell 7, they can be invoked directly as shown above; the longer commands explicitly launch Windows PowerShell.

After changing source files, run `build.ps1` again. `run.ps1` builds automatically only when the JAR is absent; it does not detect source changes.

If the scripts cannot locate an existing Java 21 JDK, the following commands prompt for its installation directory and set the override only for the current terminal session:

```powershell
$env:STAGE2_JAVA_HOME = Read-Host 'Enter the installation directory of your Java 21 JDK'
& .\scripts\build.ps1
```

## CLI demo and interactive mode

Run the deterministic demonstration with explicitly labeled fictional input:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\run.ps1 -Mode demo
```

Start the interactive CLI:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\run.ps1 -Mode cli
```

Within the interactive CLI, use the following commands:

| Command | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `prepare` | Prompt for vehicle information, buyer limits, and cost assumptions; replace the current vehicle after successful preparation. |
| `check-conflicts` | Enter a second structured record for the saved vehicle; display source differences without saving or merging values. No listing extraction is performed. |
| `:cancel` | Cancel data entry at a `prepare` or `check-conflicts` field prompt. |
| `demo` | Execute the deterministic workflow with fictional example input. |
| `show` | Display the saved current vehicle and buyer preferences. |
| `status` | Display the current LLM integration status. |
| `help` | List available commands. |
| `quit` | Exit the application. |

All session information is held in memory and is discarded when the application closes.

After building, the JAR can also be launched directly with **Java 21**:

```powershell
java -jar .\build\used-car-assistant.jar --demo
```

This direct command uses the `java` executable on `PATH`. Use the launch script if `PATH` selects an older Java version.

## GUI launch and use

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\run.ps1 -Mode gui
```

Select **Load fictional example**, review the **Vehicle**, **Preferences**, and **Cost assumptions** tabs, and then select **Save and calculate**. Alternatively, enter your own data. The results area supports scrolling and displays validation errors. After changing input, select **Save and calculate** again to obtain updated results.

To check source differences, first save the manual vehicle with **Save and calculate**. Enter the second structured record in the **Vehicle** tab, then select **Check against saved vehicle**. This action uses only the Vehicle tab and leaves the saved record unchanged. Do not select Save and calculate before comparing, because that replaces the baseline. Review both reported values and explicitly edit/save your chosen record; automatic resolution is not implemented.

The GUI and CLI use the same underlying application workflow. Neither interface currently provides all planned Stage 2 features.

## Example output and calculation conventions

The example input is stored in `src/main/resources/example.properties`. Its vehicle make and model are fictional. The tax rate, fuel price, insurance allowance, and maintenance allowance are demonstration assumptions, not current market quotations or applicable tax rules.

- Annual fuel use: 15,000 × 7.2 ÷ 100 = **1,080 L**.
- Annual fuel cost: 1,080 × 1.65 = **CAD 1,782.00**.
- Purchase tax: 18,000 × 0.13 = **CAD 2,340.00**.
- Simple first-year estimate: 18,000 + 2,340 + 1,782 + 1,000 + 1,800 = **CAD 24,922.00**.
- The asking price of CAD 18,000 exceeds the buyer's CAD 17,000 budget, producing an explicit budget conflict.

Calculations use `BigDecimal`. Monetary components are rounded to cents using `HALF_UP`, and the first-year estimate sums the rounded components. If fuel consumption is unknown, fuel results are unavailable. If any tax, maintenance, or insurance assumption is missing, a complete first-year total is not produced. An explicit zero is distinct from a blank field. Financing, depreciation, registration, and other unlisted costs are excluded.

## JUnit and local verification

Run the verification script from Stage2:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\verify.ps1
```

When the expected JUnit 4.13.2 and Hamcrest libraries are available in the installed VS Code Java extension, the script runs `FoundationTest` through JUnit. Otherwise, it reports that it is using the dependency-free runner; that fallback is not presented as a JUnit execution.

In a terminal that permits script execution, the available verification modes are:

```powershell
& .\scripts\verify.ps1                  # Prefer JUnit; explicitly fall back if unavailable
& .\scripts\verify.ps1 -DependencyFree  # Force dependency-free verification
& .\scripts\verify.ps1 -Gui             # Also open a real GUI, test its buttons, and close it
```

The thirty tests cover negative and malformed inputs, required fields and year validation, exact cost calculations, optional values, unknown fuel consumption, constraint boundaries, zero values and rounding, session preservation after rejected updates, tool/LLM boundaries, and interactive CLI processing, including transmission matching/mismatching, multiple accepted types, accident tolerance, neutral preferences, unknown values, and invalid preference input.

Ten F04 tests additionally cover missing versus unknown histories, complete and insufficient essential data, optional omissions, matching and conflicting sources, unknown values without false conflicts, session preservation, and the interactive conflict-check command.

The GUI smoke check verifies window launch, calculation, error display, recalculation, and source conflict display without overwriting the saved vehicle. It saves an image of the application's panel to `build/verification/gui.png`. These checks do not constitute complete Stage 3 testing, and KUMA validation has not been performed.

## Optional Maven workflow

`pom.xml` specifies Java 21, JUnit 4.13.2, and an executable JAR. Maven CLI was unavailable during initial scaffolding verification, so the Maven build was not verified at that stage. If Maven is already installed, configure it to use Java 21 and keep its dependency cache within Stage2:

```powershell
mvn "-Dmaven.repo.local=$PWD\build\maven-repository" test package
java -jar .\target\used-car-assistant-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --demo
```

An initial Maven build may download the declared plugins and test dependencies. No such downloads or Maven installation were performed during initial scaffolding. Maven's `test` phase runs `FoundationTest`; the GUI smoke check is an explicit local verification step and is not automatically included in the Maven test phase.

## F04 deterministic data-quality checks

`DataQualityChecker.check(vehicle)` runs through the existing agent/facade preparation workflow before cost and constraint checks, following UC04 and SD02. It returns the existing `MissingInformationResult` fields: `missingFields`, `uncertainFields`, `conflicts`, and `sufficient`. Both interfaces display all four fields.

- Blank or null optional vehicle text is **missing**; explicit `UNKNOWN` (also `UNCERTAIN`, `UNSURE`, `N/A`, `NOT KNOWN`, or `NOT PROVIDED`) is **uncertain**. Null fuel consumption is missing, never zero.
- Accident history uses `YES` or `NO`. Existing aliases `ACCIDENT_REPORTED`/`HAS_ACCIDENTS` and `NONE`/`NO_ACCIDENTS`/`ACCIDENT_FREE` are accepted. Maintenance history uses `DOCUMENTED`, `PARTIAL`, or `NONE`. Other history text remains uncertain; seller prose is not interpreted. These values are user assertions, not independently verified evidence.
- Essential fields for this increment are year, make, model, mileage, asking price, accident history, and maintenance history. Missing or uncertain essential information makes `sufficient` false. Known adverse history still counts as available data; sufficiency does not imply safety or suitability. Trim, transmission, fuel type, and fuel consumption are reported but do not determine essential-data sufficiency. Missing fuel consumption still prevents fuel-cost calculation.
- The existing `Vehicle` constructor rejects absent make/model, invalid year, absent/negative price, and negative mileage; the form also rejects missing year/mileage. Incomplete core-field drafts therefore remain unsupported. Explicit unknown make/model labels are reported as uncertain rather than accepted as sufficient identity data.
- `checkConflict(manualVehicle, extractedVehicle)` implements the Stage 1 structured-source comparison. It compares year, make, model, trim, mileage, asking price, transmission, fuel type, accident history, maintenance history, and fuel consumption. Text comparison ignores case and surrounding whitespace; existing transmission and accident aliases are normalized, and decimal scale does not create conflicts. IDs and free-text notes are not compared. Unsupported transmissions remain uncertain.
- Only two known comparable values can conflict. Each conflict retains the field and both supplied values. Missing/uncertain findings identify their source. Combined sufficiency requires both records to have sufficient essential data and no unresolved source conflicts. Neither source is merged or overwritten. The facade compares the saved manual record with the submitted second record; CLI and GUI share this operation.

This is a deterministic F04 increment, not complete F04 implementation. The second record is entered manually to represent structured extraction output. LLM listing extraction, ambiguity interpretation, automated clarification, and a dedicated conflict-resolution workflow remain planned. A source comparison concerns two descriptions of the same vehicle; it does not implement F09 comparison of competing vehicles. No risk rating or purchase recommendation is generated.

## Gemini API integration status

`LLMClient` currently defines the provider-independent boundary. `GeminiAdapter` is an explicitly unavailable architectural foundation: its `generate()` method throws an exception with a `PLANNED` message. There is no HTTP implementation, no API-key access, no `.env` loading, and no simulated AI response. Providing an API key **does not enable AI functionality in this version**.

No API key is required to build or run the deterministic demonstration.

## API key security precautions

After the provider adapter and configuration loader have been implemented, copy `.env.example` to `.env` within Stage2 and enter a key only in the local file. The current version does not read that file, so creating or supplying a real key is unnecessary at this stage.

The Stage2 ignore rules cover `.env`, `.env.*`, and `config.local.json`, while retaining the placeholder `.env.example`. Never include real keys in source code, screenshots, logs, reports, or version-controlled files. The example configuration contains placeholders only.

## Implementation status and known limitations

| Status | Features or components |
|---|---|
| **Implemented initial subsets** | F01 vehicle information entry and management; F03 buyer preference profile; F04 missing-information detection; F06 ownership-cost estimation; F07 buyer constraint checking. These subsets operate through the shared preparation workflow and do not complete the full original feature specifications. |
| **Planned features** | F02 listing-text analysis; F05 local vehicle knowledge retrieval; F08 AI-assisted risk assessment; F09 two-vehicle comparison; F10 inspection checklist generation; F11 clarification and follow-up management; F12 personalized recommendation and evaluation report. |
| **Operational pattern relationships** | Facade and Command have working workflow implementations. |
| **Architectural foundation only** | Adapter has an interface and unavailable provider implementation, without actual provider-protocol adaptation. |
| **Planned design patterns** | Strategy and Factory remain planned. |

The application does not currently provide reliability ratings, purchase recommendations, knowledge-base retrieval, disk persistence, or complete evaluation reports. Buyer constraint checks cover budget, mileage, accepted transmissions, and accident-history tolerance; session data remains in memory. Both the CLI `prepare` prompts and GUI Preferences tab accept comma-separated AUTOMATIC, MANUAL, or CVT preferences (existing AUTO/AT/MT aliases are normalized). Leave transmission preferences blank to skip the check. Accident tolerance accepts `NO_ACCIDENTS` or `ANY`; blank/UNKNOWN is neutral. Enter explicit accident history as YES or NO. Unknown or unrecognized vehicle values produce findings with severity `UNKNOWN` when the corresponding preference is set, distinct from `CONFLICT`. This increment implements the deterministic F07 rules in the preparation workflow; dedicated constraint commands and future AI evaluation/comparison integration remain planned. This repository content is an initial foundation, not a fully implemented Stage 2 submission.
